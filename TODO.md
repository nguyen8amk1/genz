# TODO
-> **GENERATE A (VERY OPINIONATED) FULLSTACK (JAVASCRIPT) CI/CD PROJECT
    WITH A SIMPLE COMMAND** 
    vd: `genz --full ` 

Currently we have 
    + 1. a dev docker environment management tool  
    + 2. a prod docker environment management tool (kinda :v)  
    but we still not have the:
        + needed dockerfiles, dockercompose [] @Current 
        + init code  
        + test ?? 


# DONE
